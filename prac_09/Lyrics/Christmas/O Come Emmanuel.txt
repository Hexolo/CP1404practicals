O Come O come Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel
Shall come to thee O Israel

O Come O Son of God most High
Deliver us from sinfulness and pride
Restore us in a childlike heart
To consecrate and set us apart

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel
Shall come to thee O Israel

O Come O come Emmanuel
O Come O come Emmanuel
O Come O come Emmanuel
O Come O come Emmanuel

O Come O Saviour of this world
The long awaited promise You foretold
And right the wrongs that man has done
We pray Your glorious Kingdom come

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel
Shall come to thee O Israel
