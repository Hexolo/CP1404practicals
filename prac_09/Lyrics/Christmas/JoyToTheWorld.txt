Joy to the World
.s V1 V2 V3

.1
Joy to the world, the Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.

.2
Joy to the world, the Saviour reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods,
Rocks, hills and plains 
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

.3
He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders of His love.
