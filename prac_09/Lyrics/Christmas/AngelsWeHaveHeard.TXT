.1
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

.0
Glo............ria in excelsis Deo!



.2
Shepherds, why this jubilee? 
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be 
Which inspire your heav'nly song?

.3
Come to Bethlehem, and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the new born King


.4
See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we raise.

Glo............ria in excelsis Deo!
