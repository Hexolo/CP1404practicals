Angels from the Realm of Glory
.s V1 V2 v3 v4

.1
Angels from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation's story
Now proclaim Messiah's birth.

.2
Come and worship, come and worship,
Worship, Christ the newborn King.

.3
Shepherds, in the field abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with us is now residing;
Yonder shines the infant light.

.4
Though an infant now we view Him,
He shall fill His Father's throne,
Gather all the nations to Him;
Every knee shall then bow down.

.5
All creation, join in praising
God the Father, Spirit, Son,
Evermore our voices raising
To th'eternal Three in One.
