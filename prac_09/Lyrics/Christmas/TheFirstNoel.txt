The First Noel

.1
The first noel the angel did say
was to certain poor shepherds 
in fields as they lay.
In fields where they
lay keeping their sheep on a cold winter's 
night that was so deep.

.2
They look-ed up and saw a star
shining in the east beyond them far.
And to the earth it gave a great light
and so it continued both day and night.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel.


.3
And by the light of that same star
three wise men came from country far.
To seek for a King was their intent
and to follow the star wherever it went.

.4 
Then entered in those wise men three
fell reverently upon their knee.
And offered there in His presence
their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

.5 
Then let us all with one accord
sing praises to our heavenly Lord.
That hath made heaven and earth of naught
and with His blood mankind has bought.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Born is the King of Israel
