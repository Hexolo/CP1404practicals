.1
Silent night, Holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

.2
Silent night, Holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories streams from heaven afar
Heavenly host sing Alleluia
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is born

.3
Silent night, Holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Your holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth

.4
Silent night! Holy night!
Wonderous Star, lend thy light
With the angels let us sing
Alleluia to our King
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born

.9
Christ the Saviour is born
