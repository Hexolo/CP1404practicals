Merry Merry Christmas

Merry Merry Christmas
Come and find forgiveness
Jesus Christ the King is born

I'm Singing
Merry Merry Christmas
Come and find forgiveness
Jesus Christ the King is born


More than Christmas Trees
More than families
More than presents
We need Jesus
More than decorations
More than celebrations
Hope for all the nations
We need Jesus


I'm Singing
Merry Merry Christmas
Come and find forgiveness
Jesus Christ the King is born
I'm singing
Merry Merry Christmas
Come and find forgiveness
Jesus Christ the King is born

More than Christmas Lights
More than Carol Nights
More than Good Times
We need Jesus
He came to save the lost
His life is what it cost
Everyone of us
We need Jesus
