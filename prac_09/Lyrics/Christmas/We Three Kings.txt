We Three Kings
.s V1 V2 C V3 V4 C V5

We three kings from Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar.
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star.


Born a king on Bethlehem's plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign.


O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us with your perfect Light.


Frankincense to offer have I.
Incense owns a Deity nigh.
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high.


Myrrh is mine: it's bitter perfume
Breaths a life of gathering gloom.
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding dying,
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.


O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us with your perfect Light.


Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice.
Alleluia, alleluia!
Sounds through the earth and skies.


O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us with your perfect Light.
