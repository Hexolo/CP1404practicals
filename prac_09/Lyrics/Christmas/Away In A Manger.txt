Away In A Manger

1. Away in a manger, No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky look down where He lay 
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

2. The cattle are lowing the Baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes
I love You, Lord Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my side, until morning is nigh.

3. Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask You to stay
Close by me forever and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in Your tender care
And take us to heaven to live with You there.
