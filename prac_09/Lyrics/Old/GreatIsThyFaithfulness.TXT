O God my Father
There is no shadow 
Of turning with Thee

Thou changest not 
Thy compassions they fail not
As Thou has been 
Thou forever will be

And springtime and harvest

And a peace that endureth

To cheer and to guide

And bright hope for tomorrow

With ten thousand beside

Morning by morning 
New mercies I see
