Unstoppable Love
Kim-Walker Smith, Skyler Smith & Christie Black

.1
Try to stop Your Love and
You would wage a war
Try to take the very thing
You gave Your life for

And You would come running
Tear down every wall
All the while shouting
My Love You are worth it all

.0 
God You pursue me with power and glory
Unstoppable Love that never ends 
You're unrelenting with passion and  mercy
Unstoppable love that never ends

.2
You broke into the silence and
Sang a song of hope
Melody resounding in the deep of my soul

And You have come running
You tore down every wall
All the while shouting 
My Love You are
