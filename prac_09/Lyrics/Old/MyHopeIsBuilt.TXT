My Hope Is Built
.s V1 Ch V2 Ch V3 Ch V4 Tag

.1
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
No merit of my own I claim
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

.0
On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand

.2
When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand

.3
His oath His covenant His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand

.4
When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

.9
On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking 
All other ground is sinking 
All other ground is sinking sand
