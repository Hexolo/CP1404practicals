.1
Before the world You knew the plans for me
Before my heart believed You came to my rescue
Now I'm found in love
There's nowhere else to run
You keep my life within Your mighty hands

.0
Oh God
There's no end to Your love
There's no end to Your love
You're with us
You're with us

There's nothing in this world
That could take You away
You're with us
You're with us

.

.2
Before I call I know You'll answer me
You'll make a way beyond what I could imagine
What could separate from the love You gave
I put my hope in everything that You are

Oh God
There's no end to Your love
There's no end to Your love
You're with us
You're with us

There's nothing in this world
That could take You away
You're with us
You're with us

.

.8
You reign in our hearts
You reign above all
Be lifted on high

There's no end to Your love
There's no end to Your love
You're with us
You're with us

There's nothing in this world
That could take You away
You're with us
You're with us
