While We Sing

.1
I've sat by far too long
And I've watched the hurting suffer on their own
I have chances every day
To live like you, die to myself, give Your love away
And I wonder why I feel so empty inside
While I sing

.0
La la la la la la la la la
As the hungry roam the streets
La la la la la la la la la
As the broken are on their knees
La la la la la la la la la
I keep singing

.2
We are frozen we are still
But we're called to be a city on a hill
And as our melodies resound
We cannot hear the silent cry 
This world is screaming out
And we wonder why, we feel so empty inside
While we sing

La la la la la la la la la
As the hungry roam the streets
La la la la la la la la la
As the broken are on their knees
La la la la la la la la la
I keep singing

Remember salvation's day
When Jesus washed our sins away
The lost are crying out to be saved
While we sing

.5
La la la la la la la la la
As the hungry roam the streets
La la la la la la la la la
As the broken are on their knees
La la la la la la la la la

We keep singing 
But just a song won't heal
The bleeding wound
Church wake up
We're sleeping in an empty tomb

.9
Church arise!
Arise and shine!
Shake yourself from the dust
God is calling us to go!
