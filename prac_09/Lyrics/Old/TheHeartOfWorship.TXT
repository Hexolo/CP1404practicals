.1
When the music fades 
And all is stripped away
And I simply come 
Longing just to bring 
Something that©s of worth
That will bless Your heart

.7
I©ll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself 
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within 
Through the way things appear
You©re looking into my heart

.0
I'm coming back 
To the heart of worship
And it's all about You
All about You, Jesus

I'm sorry Lord 
For the thing I've made it
When it's all about You
All about You, Jesus

.2
King of endless worth 
No-one could express 
How much You deserve
Though I©m weak and poor
All I have is Yours 
Every single breath

I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself 
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within 
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back 
To the heart of worship
And it's all about You
All about You, Jesus

I'm sorry Lord 
For the thing I've made it
When it's all about You
All about You, Jesus
