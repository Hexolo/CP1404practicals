I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes

.2
I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing

I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith

I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees

Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love 
Like You have loved me

Break my heart for what breaks yours
Everything I am 
For Your kingdom's cause 
As I walk from earth into eternity
