.1
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly trust in Jesus' Name

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly trust in Jesus' Name

Christ alone
Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm He is Lord
Lord of all

.

.2
When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil
My anchor holds within the veil

.5
Christ alone
Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm He is Lord
Lord of all
He is Lord
Lord of all

Christ alone
Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm He is Lord
Lord of all

.3
When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
   Faultless stand before the throne

Christ alone
Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm He is Lord
Lord of all
