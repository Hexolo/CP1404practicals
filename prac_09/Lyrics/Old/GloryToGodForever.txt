Before the world was made
Before You spoke it to be
You were the King of kings
Yeah You were yeah You were
And now You're reigning still
Enthroned above all things
Angels and saints cry out
We join them as we sing

Creator God You gave me breath
So I could praise
Your great and matchless name
All my days all my days
So let my whole life be
A blazing offering
A life that shouts and sings
The greatness of our King
