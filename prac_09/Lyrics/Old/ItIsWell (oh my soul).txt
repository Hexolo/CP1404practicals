It Is Well (Oh My Soul)
Brandon Heath

.1
When peace, like a river, 
attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot, You taught me to say
It is Well, It is Well with My Soul

.2
My Sin, oh, the bliss, of this glorious thought  my sin
Not in part but the whole
Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more
Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, oh my soul

.0
It is well with my soul, here's my heart, make it whole
For You I live, in You I dwell, oh my soul
It is well

.3
And, Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be my sight
The clouds be rolled back like a scroll
The trumpet will sound and the Lord will descend
Even so, it is well with my soul

.0 
It is well with my soul, here's my heart, make it whole
For You I live, in You I dwell, oh my soul

.0
It is well with my soul, here's my heart, make it whole
For You I live, in You I dwell, oh my soul
It is well with my soul, here's my heart, make it whole
For You I live, in You I dwell, oh my soul

.9
Oh, my soul, Oh, my soul, it is well
