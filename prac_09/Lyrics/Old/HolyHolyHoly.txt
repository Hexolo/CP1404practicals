.1
Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity

.2
Holy, holy, holy though the darkness hide Thee
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see
Only Thou art holy there is none beside Thee
Perfect in power, in love, and purity

.3
Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty
All Thy works shall praise Thy Name in earth and sky and sea
Holy, holy, holy merciful and mighty
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity
