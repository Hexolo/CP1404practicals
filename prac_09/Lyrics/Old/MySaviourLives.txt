.1
Our God will reign forever
And all the world will know His Name
Everyone together
Sing the song of the redeemed

I know that my Redeemer lives
And now I stand on what He did
My Saviour my Saviour lives

Every day a brand new chance to say
Jesus You are the Only Way
My Saviour my Saviour lives

.

.2
The King has come from heaven
And darkness trembles at His Name
Victory forever
Is the song of the redeemed

I know that my Redeemer lives
And now I stand on what He did
My Saviour my Saviour lives

Every day a brand new chance to say
Jesus You are the Only Way
My Saviour my Saviour lives

And now I stand on what He did
My Saviour my Saviour lives

Every day a brand new chance to say
Jesus You are the Only Way

And now I stand on what He did
My Saviour my Saviour lives

Every day a brand new chance to say
Jesus You are the Only Way
My Saviour my Saviour lives
