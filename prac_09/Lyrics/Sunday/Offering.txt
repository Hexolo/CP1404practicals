Over the skies of Bethlehem appeared a star
While angels sang to lowly shepherds

Three wise men seeking truth 
They travelled from afar
Hoping to find the child from Heaven

Falling on their knees 
They bow before the humble Prince of Peace


I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus, may You receive the honour that You're due  
O Lord, I bring an offering to You
I bring an offering to You
 
.1
The sun cannot compare 
To the glory of Your love
There is no shadow in Your presence

No mortal man would dare
To stand before Your throne
Before the Holy One of Heaven

.7
It's only by Your blood
And it's only through Your mercy
Lord, I come

I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus, may You receive the honour that You're due  
O Lord, I bring an offering to You
I bring an offering to You

.2
I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus, may You receive the honour that You're due  
O Lord, I bring an offering to You
O Lord, I bring an offering to You
O Lord, I bring an offering to You
I bring an offering to You
