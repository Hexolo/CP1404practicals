In my wrestling and in my doubts
In my failures You won't walk out
Your great love will lead me through 
You are the peace in my troubled sea
whoa oh
You are the peace in my troubled sea

In the silence You won't let go 
In the questions Your truth will hold 
Your great love will lead us through 
You are the peace in my troubled sea
whoa oh
You are the peace in my troubled sea

With each morning I'll rise and sing
