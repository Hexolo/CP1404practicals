Grace Alone

.1
I was an orphan, lost at the fall
Running away when I'd hear you call
But Father, you worked your will
.2
I had no righteousness of my own
I had no right to draw near your throne
But Father, you loved me still
.3
And in love, before you laid the world's foundation
You predestined to adopt me as your own
You have raised me up so high above my station
I'm a child of God by grace, and grace alone



.4
You left your home to seek out the lost
You knew the great and terrible cost
But Jesus, your face was set
.5
I worked my fingers down to the bone 
Nothing I did could ever atone 
Jesus, you paid my debt
.6
By your blood I have redemption and salvation
Lord you died that I might reap what you have sown
And you rose that I might be a new creation
I am born again by grace, and grace alone



.7
I was in darkness all of my life
I never knew the day from the night
But Spirit, you made me see
.8
I swore I knew the way on my own
Head full of rocks, a heart made of stone
But Spirit, you moved in me
.9
And at your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened
On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone
Called into a kingdom that cannot be shaken
Heaven's citizen by grace, and by grace alone
.10
So I'll stand in faith by grace, and grace alone
I will run the race by grace, and grace alone
I will slay my sin by grace, and grace alone
I will reach the end by grace, and grace alone
