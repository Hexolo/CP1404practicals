.1
My soul finds rest in God alone
My rock and my salvation
A fortress strong against my foes
And I will not be shaken

Though lips may bless and hearts may curse
And lies like arrows pierce me
I'll fix my heart on righteousness
I'll look to Him who hears me

.0
Oh oh praise Him hallelujah
My Delight and my Reward
Everlasting never failing
My Redeemer my God

.

.2
Find rest my soul in God alone
Amid the world's temptations
When evil seeks to take a hold
I'll cling to my salvation

Though riches come and riches go
Don't set your heart upon them
The fields of hope in which I sow
Are harvested in heaven

Oh oh praise Him hallelujah
My Delight and my Reward
Everlasting never failing
My Redeemer my God

.

.3
I'll set my gaze on God alone
And trust in Him completely
With every day pour out my soul
And He will prove His mercy

Though life is but a fleeting breath
A sigh too brief to measure
My King has crushed the curse of death
And I am His forever

Oh oh praise Him hallelujah
My Delight and my Reward
Everlasting never failing
My Redeemer my God

.8
Oh oh praise Him Oh oh praise Him
Hallelujah hallelujah

Oh oh praise Him hallelujah
My Delight and my Reward
Everlasting never failing
My Redeemer my God
