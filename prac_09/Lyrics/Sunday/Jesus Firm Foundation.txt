How firm a foundation you saints of the Lord
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word
What more can He say than to you He has said
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled

.2
Fear not He is with us O be not dismayed
For He is our God our Sustainer and Strength
He'll be our defender and cause us to stand
Upheld by His merciful almighty hand

How firm our foundation 
How sure our salvation 
And we will not be shaken 
Jesus firm foundation

.3
The soul that is trusting in Jesus as Lord
Will press on enduring the darkest of storm
And though even hell should endeavour to shake
He'll never no never no never forsake 
He'll never no never no never forsake

How firm our foundation 
How sure our salvation 
And we will not be shaken 
Jesus firm foundation

Age to age He stands faithful to the end
All may fade away but He will remain
He will remain


How firm our foundation 
How sure our salvation 
And we will not be shaken 
Jesus firm foundation
