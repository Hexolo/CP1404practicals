How Great Thou Art

.1
O Lord my God when I 
In awesome wonder
Consider all the works 
Thy hands have made 

I see the stars 
I hear the mighty thunder
Thy power throughout 
The universe displayed

.0
Then sings my soul 
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art  
How great Thou art

.2
When through the woods
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly
In the trees

When I look down from 
Lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel
The gentle breeze

.0
Then sings my soul 
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art  
How great Thou art

.3
And when I think that God 
His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die 
I scarce can take it in

That on the cross 
My burden gladly bearing
He bled and died 
To take away my sin

Then sings my soul 
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art  
How great Thou art

.3
When Christ shall come 
With shout of acclamation
And take me home what joy 
Shall fill my heart

Then I shall bow 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim my God
How great Thou art

Then sings my soul 
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art  
How great Thou art
