Man of Sorrows
.s V1 V2C C V3 C BB C V4 C T

.1
Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
By His own betrayed
The sin of man and wrath of God 
Has been on Jesus laid

.2
Silent as He stood accused
Beaten mocked and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns

.0
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out, hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee

.3
Sent of heaven, God's own Son 
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones 
Who nailed Him to that tree

.0 
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out, hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee 

.8
Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full
By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled
Now, the curse of sin has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free, oh is free indeed

.0
 Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out, hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee 

.4
See the stone is rolled away, 
Behold the empty tomb
Hallelujah God be praised, 
He's risen from the grave

.9
Praise and honour unto Thee
