I want to scream it out
From every mountain top
Your goodness knows no bounds
Your goodness never stops

Your mercy follows me
Your kindness fills my life
Your Love amazes me

And I sing because You are good
And I dance because You are good
And I shout because You are good
You are good to me

Nothing and no one comes
Anywhere close to You
The earth and oceans deep
Only reflect this truth

And in my darkest night
You shine as bright as day
Your Love amazes me

And I dance because You are good
And I shout because You are good
You are good to me 

And I sing because You are good
And I dance because You are good
And I shout because You are good

In the sun or rain my life celebrates
