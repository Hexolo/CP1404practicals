.1
Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns 
All music but its own

Awake my soul and sing 
Of Him who died for me
And hail Him as thy matchless King 
Through all eternity

.0
Majesty Lord of all
Let ev'ry throne be-fore Him fall
The King of Kings O come adore
Our God who reigns for-ever-more

.2
Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save

His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

.8
All hail Re-deemer hail for He died for me
His praise and glory shall not fail through-out e-terni-ty

.0
Majesty Lord of all
Let ev'ry throne be-fore Him fall
The King of Kings O come adore
Our God who reigns for-ever-more

Praise God who reigns for-ever-more
You're the God who reigns for-ever-more
