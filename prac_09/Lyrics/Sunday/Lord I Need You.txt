Lord I Come I Confess
Bowing here I find my rest
And without You I fall apart
You're the one
That guides my heart

Lord I need You oh I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defence
My righteousness
Oh God how I need You

Where sin runs deep
Your grace is more
Where grace is found
Is where You are
And where you are 
Lord I am free
Holiness is Christ in me

So teach my song
To rise to You
When temptation comes my way
And when I cannot stand
I'll fall on You
Jesus You're my hope and stay
