When You found me, I was so blind
My sin was before me, I was swallowed by pride
But out of the darkness, You brought me to Your light
You showed me new mercy and opened up my eyes

From the day You saved my soul
'Til the very moment when I come home
I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow
From the day You saved my soul

Where brilliant light is all around
And endless joy is the only sound
Oh, rest my heart forever now
Oh, in Your arms I'll always be found

From the day You saved my soul
'Til the very moment when I come home
I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow
From the day You saved my soul

My love is Yours
My heart is Yours
My life is Yours
Forever

My love is Yours
My heart is Yours
My life is Yours
Forever

From the day You saved my soul
'Til the very moment when I come home
I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow
From the day You saved my soul

From the day You saved my soul
'Til the very moment when I come home
I'll sing, I'll dance, my heart will overflow
From the day You saved my soul
From the day You saved my soul
