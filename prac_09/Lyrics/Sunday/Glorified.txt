.1
Praise belongs to You
Let every kingdom bow
Let every ocean roar
Let every heart adore You now

.2
Praise belongs to You
What can I do but sing
The greatest joy I've found
Is to lay a crown before my King
Before my King

.0
I've come to worship
I've come to lift up Your Name
For You deserve this life laid down
Like the one that You gave

I have but one voice
One heart and one sacrifice
So would You take this life laid down and
Be glorified 
Be glorified

.3
Praise belongs to You
Let songs from children rise
You silence all Your foes
You set Your glory in the skies

.4
Praise belongs to You
Creation's calling now
For the King to be revealed
O King of Heaven come down
King of Heaven come down


.

.5
I've come to worship
I've come to lift up Your Name
For You deserve this life laid down
Like the one that You gave

I have but one voice
One heart and one sacrifice
So would You take this life laid down and
Be glorified 
Be glorified 
Be glorified 
Be glorified
