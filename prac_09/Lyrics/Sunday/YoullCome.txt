I have decided
I have resolved 
To wait upon You Lord
My Rock and Redeemer 
Shield and reward 
l wait upon You Lord

As surely as the sun will rise 
You'll come to us 
Certain as the dawn appears

Let Your glory fall 
As You respond to us
Spirit rain 
Flood into our thirsty hearts again 
You'll come
You'll come

We are not shaken
We are not moved 
We wait upon You Lord 
Mighty Deliverer
Triumph and Truth

As surely as the sun will rise 
You'll come to us 
Certain as your Word endures

Let Your glory fall 
As You respond to us
Spirit rain 
Flood into our thirsty hearts again 
You'll come
You'll come
