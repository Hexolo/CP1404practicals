Oceans (Where Feet  May Fail)
Matt Crocker, Joel Houston Salomon Ligtelim

.1

You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In Oceans deep
My faith will stand

.0

And I will call upon your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine


.


.2

Your Grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and You won't start now


So  I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

.

.8

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me

Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour

.8
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me

Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour


And  I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine
