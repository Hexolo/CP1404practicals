The Lord is King

.1
You might have seen bad things happening
On the TV news
You might be worryin' 'bout the world
And wonder what will happen to you
Well put your trust in God alone
'Cos He's still sittin' on His mighty throne

The Lord is King
He's gonna look after everything
Everything
The Lord is King
He's gonna look after everything
Every single thing in this world
'Cos this is His world

You might get sad and wonder
Why there's so much pain
Why we let the same mistakes
Happen over and over again
Our sinful ways will always fail
But God and His ways will prevail because

You kings be wise you rulers
Hear the Lord's decree
He sees He knows He'll judge
In fearsome majesty
But blessed are all who find their place
In the shelter of His grace because

(Ending)
He rules the world
Yeah this is His world
